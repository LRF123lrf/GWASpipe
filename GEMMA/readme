It is a good practice to install the package in a clean environment.
So first create a new environment (you can name it as you like), here with the exemplary name 'myenv':
conda create -n myenv

Next, activate the environment by typing:
conda activate myenv

Now, the vcf2gwas package can be installed:
conda install vcf2gwas -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c fvogt257 

Everything is ready for analysis now.
Optionally, to test the installation and copy the example files to your current working directory, run:
vcf2gwas -v test

Once the analysis is completed, the environment can be deactivated:
conda deactivate


To download the vcf2gwas docker image, run the following command:
docker pull fvogt257/vcf2gwas

Everything is ready for analysis now.
Optionally, to test the image and copy the example files to your current working directory, run:
docker run -v /path/to/current-working-directory/:/vcf2gwas/ fvogt257/vcf2gwas -v test
